       "AIMessage(content=\"Great choice! Chicken Tikka Masala is a delicious dish, and I can help you make a vegetarian version of it. Instead of using chicken, we can replace it with a vegetarian protein option like tofu or paneer. Here's how you can modify the recipe:\\n\\nIngredients:\\n- 500g tofu or paneer, cut into bite-sized pieces\\n- 1 cup plain yogurt\\n- 2 tablespoons lemon juice\\n- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil\\n- 1 large onion, finely chopped\\n- 3 cloves of garlic, minced\\n- 1-inch piece of ginger, grated\\n- 2 teaspoons ground cumin\\n- 2 teaspoons ground coriander\\n- 1 teaspoon turmeric powder\\n- 1 teaspoon paprika\\n- 1 teaspoon garam masala\\n- 1 cup tomato puree\\n- 1 cup heavy cream (or substitute with coconut cream for a vegan version)\\n- Salt, to taste\\n- Fresh cilantro, for garnish\\n\\nInstructions:\\n1. In a bowl, combine the yogurt, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon of cumin, 1 teaspoon of coriander, turmeric powder, paprika, and salt. Add the tofu or paneer pieces and mix well. Marinate for at least 1 hour, or overnight in the refrigerator for better flavor.\\n\\n2. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Place the marinated tofu or paneer on a baking sheet and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until slightly golden. Set aside.\\n\\n3. In a large pan, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until golden brown, stirring occasionally.\\n\\n4. Add the minced garlic and grated ginger to the pan and cook for another minute.\\n\\n5. Add the remaining cumin, coriander, garam masala, and salt. Stir well to combine the spices with the onion mixture.\\n\\n6. Pour in the tomato puree and cook for 5 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.\\n\\n7. Reduce the heat to low and stir in the heavy cream (or coconut cream). Simmer for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.\\n\\n8. Add the cooked tofu or paneer to the sauce and simmer for an additional 5 minutes, allowing the flavors to blend.\\n\\n9. Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve hot with steamed rice or naan bread.\\n\\nEnjoy your homemade Vegetarian Tikka Masala!\")"
